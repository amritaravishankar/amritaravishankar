### Hi there 👋 I'm Amrita!

I'm a Final Year Computer Science Undergraduate at Nanyang Technological University.
I'm currently pursuing a specialisation in High Performance Computing and Artifical Intelligence.

I love taking up challenges and tasks which require thinking out-of-the-box!

I have a keen interest in learning more, each day, in the field of Computer Science, especially Software Engineering!
